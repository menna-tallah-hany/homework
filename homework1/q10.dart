/*
Explain what happens if you try to use a variable before it is declared in Dart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you try to use a variable before it is declared in Dart, the program will
 produce a compile-time error because Dart requires variables to be declared
  before they are used.
 This helps prevent unexpected behavior and ensures that the compiler knows the 
 variable’s type and value before execution.
